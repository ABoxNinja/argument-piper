# x63
x63 is a tiny piper that mostly works with user input, randomly generated, or set by the programmer in the CLI.

x63 randomizes inputs for your program without the need of spending time testing all the edge cases by hand.

### Usage:

Example Input:
```
x63 test.exe
```
Example Output:
```
test.exe -> [OK]
        input: 56
        input type: integer
```
OR
```
test.exe -> [FAILED]
        input: 79.4
        input type: float
```
